# School_District_Analysis
This repository uses Jupyter Notebook and PythonData to produce school district information for a client.

## Overview of School District Analysis ##

This school district wanted summaries of student and school performance in their district. After providing this analysis, the school district suspected some dishonest test scores in a subset of students in one school. Because of this, their scores were replaced with NaN values and the analysis was refactored. After I completed this analysis, this school district can evaluate the impact of total budgets per school, spending per student, school size, on crucial markers like test scores and overall student performance.

## Results ##

The school district specifically wanted me to analyze the student performance at one school, since this was the school where they uncovered academic dishonesty. 

The seven school district metrics were:
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Percentage (%) Passing Math
* Percentage (%) Passing Reading
* Percentage (%) Passing Overall



## Summary
When I re-ran the code, there were some noteworthy changes between my original and new analysis.
